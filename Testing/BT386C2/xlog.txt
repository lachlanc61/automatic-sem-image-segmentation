PROBLEM:
    consistently assigning background noise as particles


    in UNet_Seg

    eg. 0045 = image #3

    run_inference
        :283 load and preproc
            applies norm, threshold, contrast opt

        :295 preprocessed image to pass to unet
            eg. 0045 exposure dialled up significantly
            -> hot and cold?
        
        :302 output of unet
            -> produces an image? thought it was a segmentation mask...
            -> picks up lots of background



    helperfuncs
        load_and_preprocess_images

    UNET_CONTRAST_OPT_RANGE is percentiles - normalises between eg. 1% and 99% (ie. hotter=white, darker=black)
        
        currently using quite a broad definition, accentuates noise heavily


    >>>USE WIDER RANGE OF PERCENTILES to prevent amplification of noise
        = 0.1, 99.9
    >>>DONE


    >>> adjust assemblies from WGAN to better match images 
        - real images are much more clustered than fake assemblies
    in WGAN.simulate_masks



    >>> adjust filter_gan_masks to more aggressively discard particles that are just noise
    in helperfuncs.filter_gan_masks
